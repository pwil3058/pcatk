DESCRIPTION:

This software is intended for use by painters who wish to experiment
with mixing paint (virtually) and to plan palettes.  See section USAGE
below for more details.

STATUS:

This software is still under development and is only Beta standard at
this time.

REQUIREMENTS:

Requires Rust version rustc 1.26.2 or later.

INSTALLATION:

It is NOT necessary to install this software in order to use it.For the Rust
version all that is required is for the .target/release and/or
.target/debug (as appropriate) to be in the user's PATH environment
variable.

USAGE:

The software's GUI pcatk_rs has 2 selectable components:

1. The Palette Planner is a GUI the component that (once the user
has selected some paint colours for use) enables the painter to mix new
colours by specifying the number of "parts" of paint (or earlier mixed)
colours to be used in a mixed colour.  This mixed colour can then be
saved to a list of mixed colours (along with notes about its intended
use) and used in the mixing of further colours.  When the painter has
finished planning their palette they may print out a report to be used
as a reference while completing the painting for which the palette was
planned.

2. The Paint Series Editor is the component that enables the
painter create sets of paint colours for use in the palette planner.
The recommended method is to produce a "sampler" of the actual paints
to be used on a suitable medium, take a digital photograph and then
cut and paste from that photograph into the paint series editor where
its buttons can be used to match the colour.  A Colour Sample Viewer
is included as part of the editor. An example colour sampler
file has been added and should be loaded by the viewer the first time
it is launched (and after that it should remember the last file used).

TUBE SERIES:

At this time, the only paint series data included in the distribution is for an
imaginary set of paints known as the "Ideal Paint Colours Series" which
features six colours equally spaced around the colour circle (at maximum chroma)
together with black and white. This series can be found in the file "ideal_paints.json"
in the "data" subdirectory of the source distribution.

INTERNATIONALIZATION:

Not available.
